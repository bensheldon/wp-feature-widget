## About

This Wordpress plugin creates a widget, post-meta-box, and image slider (using WP Featured Image functionality) to create a fancy-schmancy image-slider on your wordpress blog.

## Installation

1. Place the files in your wp-content/plugins folder
2. Create a post with a featured image
3. Check the "Display as Featured Item" option in the box that should appear beneath your post's body in the Edit screen.
